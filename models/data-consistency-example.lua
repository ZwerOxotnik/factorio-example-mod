--[[
	This is just a particular example, not a guide. You don't have to follow this example at all!

	We gonna use https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/Global.html to store data and some local table for singleplayer in some cases.

	There are some subtle differences between singleplayer and multiplayer.
	For instance: when a player start a map in singleplayer, the script won't use some events:
		defines.events.on_player_joined_game -- it works only when a player joins first time in singleplayer
		defines.events.on_player_left_game

	That leads some issues in other events.
	Usually, it's not a problem if data doesn't depend on those events or some related data isn't empty.
	We might use on_init and on_configuration_changed to always have some data.
	But it depends on your cases etc.

	So, in this example, we don't store data in global for players when they are offline and we're not going to "adapt" the data for singleplayer.
